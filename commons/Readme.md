# RadioactiveNarwhalsShop :: Commons

## Introduction

For demonstration purposes, project commons is divided into three major packages `anti.pattern`, `vanilla` and `safe`:

##### Anti Pattern

Sometimes, when we are so focused on making code simple and easy to read, we may tend to follow old patterns and forget
why functional programming can be a better paradigm.
The Anti Pattern package has everything implemented in the most possible old-fashion way possible. Consider this the
same as going through memory lane between lat 90's and early 00's. The code is completely implemented in an imperative
way. There is no declarative or functional programming involved in this package.

##### Vanilla

The vanilla solution intends to provide an alternative to Decimals by factoring numbers by 1000 in order to keep 3
decimals as the significant information of a certain unit.
However, the package is intended to show why this solution can present problems.

##### Safe

The safe solution is an implementation using only BigDecimals to keep precision. The idea is to show that whatever the
case, it is also important to weigh in this option even though it might seem complex and difficult to understand or
implement.
