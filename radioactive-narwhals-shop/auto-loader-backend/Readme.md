# Auto Loader Backend

## Introduction

This is an example to show how to autoload an application with pre-existing data.

This is an `anti-pattern` and in this case we are illustrating what exactly not to do with an application.

```shell
java -jar target/auto-loader-backend.jar -f ../commons/src/test/resources/narwhals1.xml -d 13
```
