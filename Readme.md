# QA Mastering Apps

## Introduction

This project contains examples where the idea is to explore best practices around different programming technologies

## Moved projects

Repos under handler [jesperancinha](https://github.com/jesperancinha) can be difficult to manage, especially if they are very small. Therefore, in order to be able to handle small projects better, some of them have been moved to here:

* [library-books](library-books)
* [online-product-shop](online-product-shop)
* [radioactive-narwhals-shop](radioactive-narwhals-shop)
* [rockstars-manager](rockstars-manager)
* [supermarket](supermarket)
* [mancalaje](mancalaje)
* [car-lease](car-lease)

All of these projects used to be in separated repos, but eventually managing them became too costly for what they are and represent.
