## Intro

--- Under Construction ---

This repository is here to show and try to break the stereotype that sequences "are complex".
Kotlin sequences do allow for a much better presentable and beautiful code and standardizes the way we implement
algorithms.

The story that backs-up this article is located in [Narwhals.md](Narwhals.md).

## Project Layout

-   [commons](commons) - A common library where the domain and the data transfer objects are shared
-   [rn-data-reader](rn-data-reader) - A data reader for input files in XML format
-   [backend](backend) - The go-to solution for the current case
-   [backend-long](backend-long) -  A solution based on old paradigms, filled with anti-patterns and old software patterns now obsolete. In the code references to anti-pattern will be used to refer code used by this module.
-   [backend-long-vanilla](backend-long-vanilla) - One solution that avoids using decimals by using long

>NOTE: The `long` and `long-vanilla` solutions are currently being implemented, and they have started out as blatant copies of the `backend`.

## How to build

Build everything in one go with command:

```shell
make b
```
